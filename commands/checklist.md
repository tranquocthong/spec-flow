# /sf:checklist — SD §13.2 → CHECKLIST.yaml

> **Re-anchor:** read `.spec-flow/STATE.md` (its **Next Step**) before acting; run `state-update` after each step so the flow survives long sessions.

Input: `$ARGUMENTS` (feature name; SD read via trace).

Generates `.spec-flow/specs/<feature>/CHECKLIST.yaml` — **co-located with the SD** (one home per feature: SD + CHECKLIST + file-links together). spec-flow always passes this full path to `run-checklist.sh`, so the bundled **manual-test skill stays generic and unchanged** (its own scripts still default to `.claude/docs/manual-tests/` for standalone use outside spec-flow). Each §13.2 TC row → one checklist test (TC id → `test.id`; Flow → suite; Test Case → `name`; Expected Result → assertion hint).

The engine emits a **scaffold** — it cannot know endpoint paths or the right assertion shape. Those are filled in the next step, by **you (the agent), from the SD** — not by the user. SD approval was the only human gate; the user reviews your filled checklist, they do not hand-fill 153 TODOs.

## Steps
1. `node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/flow-tools.cjs checklist-gen --sd .spec-flow/specs/<feature>/SD.md --feature <feature>` — writes the scaffold. **If a CHECKLIST.yaml already exists the engine returns `CHECKLIST_EXISTS` and stops** — pass `--force` only to deliberately regenerate from SD (this overwrites all filled assertions; only do it when §13.2 changed substantially via `/sf:resync` and the old checklist is no longer valid).
   - **Token scaffold auto-detects auth model** (via `scripts/detect-auth.sh` from the manual-test skill). `X-Userinfo` (`payload:`) is **Summer/APISIX-only**, so it is emitted *only* for a project that detects as `summer`; everything else — `jwt-basic`, `session`, `no-auth`, `unknown` — gets the standard `bearer: "${TOKEN}"` form, which is what the rest of the world puts on the wire. The detector also catches **custom Bearer schemes with no JWT library** (e.g. Node/Express validating a static `Authorization: Bearer <api_key>`) by grepping the source, not just dependencies. Detection wrong anyway? Regenerate with an explicit `--auth summer` / `--auth jwt-basic`, or hand-edit the `tokens.user_token` block before filling the rest.
   - **Smoke is the happy-path spine, not the whole set.** The generator tags the **first non-`Edge:` TC of each Flow** `smoke` and every other TC `regression` — one smoke test per user story, so `--tag smoke` stays a fast gate and the smoke → regression escalation means something. Retag by hand if the SD's first row for a flow isn't the representative happy path.
   - **Unauthenticated tests**: a test that must send *no* auth header (401 cases, public endpoints) uses `token: none` — or simply omits the `token:` line. Do **not** invent a token entry for it; any other unmatched name is a real error.
2. **Fill every test from the SD yourself.** For each test: set `request` (method/path/token) from SD §9.2 — or §10 Internal Process Design for an event-driven feature — then choose the assertion by feature type:
   - **read / transform** (e.g. masking, projection — no DB write): assert `expect.body` field(s) == the SD §13.2 Expected Result value. This IS a valid PASS; do NOT invent a `verify:` SQL block where nothing is persisted.
   - **mutation** (writes a row/event): delete the `body` stub and add a `verify:` SQL block asserting the real DB/Redis delta (SD §7.2 columns), per `test-rigor.md` MUST-2/3.
   - **pure unit transform** (a TC with no endpoint — e.g. a util `maskPhone("x")→"y"` case): this is a unit test owned by BUILD, not a manual test. Tag it `no-verify` or remove it from the checklist; do NOT fabricate a `/api/v1/...` endpoint for it.
   - **event-driven / cross-service** (no synchronous HTTP surface — e.g. outbox → CDC → publisher → callback): not curl-able as a request/expect. Tag it `live-e2e` (verified by a live run, surfaced as a VERIFICATION gap) rather than leaving a fake HTTP stub.
   > **Carve-out tag — ONE place:** put `no-verify` / `live-e2e` in the test's **`tags:` list** (e.g. `tags: [regression, live-e2e]`). That single source is read by BOTH `checklist-status` and `lint-checklist`. (For a non-HTTP feature, `checklist-gen` already emits the `live-e2e` tag for you — see step 1.) You do NOT also need it in the name.
3. Check progress any time: `node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/flow-tools.cjs checklist-status --feature <feature>` — classifies each test `filled` / `scaffold` (still has TODO stubs) / `no-verify` / `live-e2e` and reports `ready` (no scaffold left). Use it instead of eyeballing the file.
4. Run `scripts/lint-checklist.sh .spec-flow/specs/<feature>/CHECKLIST.yaml` (must pass: no TODO markers, every test has an assertion). Then present the filled checklist to the user for review before `/sf:phase`.

> Deterministic scaffold (no subagent); the agent fills it from the SD.

> **To run the checklist** (after it's filled): use `/sf:manual-test <feature>` — not this command.
